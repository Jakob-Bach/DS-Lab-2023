# Data Science Laboratory Course 2023

This is the supervisor repo of the ["Data Science Laboratory Course"](https://dbis.ipd.kit.edu/3211_3244.php) at KIT in 2023.
Students worked on two subtasks:

- a practive competition from the platform [drivendata.org](https://www.drivendata.org/)
- one of two research tasks

The repo provides files for preparing the datasets, some basic exploration, course-internal splitting, scoring, and demo submissions for that.
Additionally, `Surveys/` contains exports of questionnaires (created with ILIAS `v7`) to evaluate the students' satisfication
(one survey at start of course, one after first task, one after second task).
